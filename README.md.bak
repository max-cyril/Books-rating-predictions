# Books-rating-predictions
Nowadays with so many books available, it can be hard to select the best ones to read. The
dataset provided is a curation of Goodreads books based on real user information. It can be
used for many tasks like predicting a book’s rating or recommending new books.
Below is the information you have regarding the dataset attributes:
	1) bookID: A unique identification number for each book.
	2) title: The name under which the book was published.
	3) authors: The names of the authors of the book. Multiple authors are delimited by “/”.
	4) average_rating: The average rating of the book received in total.
	5) isbn: Another unique number to identify the book, known as the International
	Standard Book Number.
	6) isbn13: A 13-digit ISBN to identify the book, instead of the standard 11-digit ISBN.
	7) language_code: Indicates the primary language of the book. For instance, “eng” is
	standard for English.
	8) num_pages: The number of pages the book contains.
	9) ratings_count: The total number of ratings the book received.
	10) text_reviews_count: The total number of written text reviews the book received.
	11) publication_date: The date the book was published.
	12) publisher: The name of the book publisher.

attributes in the dataset.
